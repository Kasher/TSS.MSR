//! Cryptography used to build and check TPM structures on the host.
//!
//! This module is split into two layers. [`provider`] defines the primitives TSS.Rust needs from
//! a crypto backend, and [`software_provider`] supplies one built on the pure-Rust RustCrypto
//! crates.
//! [`Crypto`] sits on top and adds the logic that the TPM 2.0 specification defines in terms of
//! those primitives — digest sizes, KDFa, signature validation — which is the same regardless of
//! which backend is in use.
//!
//! There is no ambient default backend. Every operation that needs one takes a
//! [`CryptoProvider`](provider::CryptoProvider) from its caller, so which backend runs is always
//! visible at the call site. [`Tpm2`](crate::tpm2_impl::Tpm2) holds the provider it was built with
//! and supplies it to the command dispatch path on the caller's behalf.
