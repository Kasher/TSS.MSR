//! The pluggable crypto backend interface.
//!
//! TSS.Rust needs a handful of cryptographic primitives to build TPM structures on the host: to
//! hash a public area into a name, to derive session keys with KDFa, to wrap an activation
//! credential, and so on. Which library performs those primitives is a deployment decision, not a
//! protocol decision, so it is expressed here as a value the caller supplies.
//!
//! A provider is a plain struct of function pointers rather than a trait object. That keeps
//! [`CryptoProvider`] `Copy`, lets it be built in a `const` context, and means threading one
//! through a call chain costs no more than passing a pointer. This mirrors how `jsonwebtoken`
//! models its own pluggable backend.
//!
//! Deliberately, there is no process-wide default provider. TSS.Rust is built as a `cdylib` as
//! well as an `rlib`, and hosts that load and unload it repeatedly would have to reason about the
//! lifetime of any global. Requiring the provider at the call site also lets a single process use
//! two backends at once, which is what makes cross-provider equivalence testing possible.
//!
//! Only primitives belong here. Logic defined by the TPM 2.0 specification — digest sizes, KDFa,
//! signature validation — is built on top of these primitives by [`Crypto`](super::Crypto) and is
//! identical no matter which backend is in use.
